# Project Ion

Project Ion is an architecture for applications that follows the following rules:
  - Only write what you mean - no boilerplate.
  - Code can easily be moved between client(s) and server.
  - Visualizations of data are all through functional projections that update automatically (MDV).
  - Code is generated wherever possible.

Ion is written in Java, so can be run on a Java server (JVM8+), Web client (using GWT), and eventually Android (pending JVM8) and iOS (J2ObjC).
